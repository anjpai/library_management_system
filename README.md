# library_management_system

Library Management System using the MERN stack is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed for efficient management of books, borrowers, and borrowing transactions within a library. Built with the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—this application allows users to seamlessly manage book details, borrower information, and borrowing activities. The platform offers features like adding new books, tracking borrowed items, managing user profiles, and generating detailed reports. It is designed to offer a smooth and intuitive user experience for library management.
Tracks items: LMS tracks items owned by the library, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who have borrowed.
Maintains records: LMS keeps track of books published, given out, and added to the library. It also maintains records of members, including how many books they've borrowed and when they're due
